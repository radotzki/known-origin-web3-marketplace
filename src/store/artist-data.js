    bio: 'Hello, I\'m Barrie J Davies and I\'m an artist (born 1977) I\'m a British artist from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, Wales. I graduated from the Southampton Institute with a Fine Art degree in 2000 and I completed my Master\'s Degree at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff in 2004. I now live and work in Brighton, England UK. My artwork is a fun colourful psychedelic and humourous approach to expose the human condition: notions of success, money, glamour, love, death, sex, gender & religion are picked at with dry comedic use of tragedy meshed with absurdity.',

    bio: 'Laura Hawkins is a designer and illustrator based in Manchester. Her illustration alias ‘Paper Hawk’ was born of her desire to create illustrations full of character, charm and life - that weren\'t \'perfect\', but who\'s imperfections were what made them interesting.Working in graphic design since graduating from Falmouth College of Arts back in 2005 Laura had been increasingly drawn to illustration. After a recent move from London to Manchester, she began experimenting with using paper as the \'paint\', and discovered a passion she never knew existed.Her aim with Paper Hawk is to make engaging, interesting and unique illustrations that bring a brief to life. Using papers salvaged from magazines, newspapers, recycling bins, empty paper packaging, and donations from friends and colleagues her work aims to giving new life to something that would otherwise be discarded. She also creates some of the papers herself by painting with watercolours or inks and then tearing these up too.',
